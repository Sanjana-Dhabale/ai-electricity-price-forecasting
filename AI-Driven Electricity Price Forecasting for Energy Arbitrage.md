### **Machine Learning for Real-Time Electricity Price Forecasting and Energy Arbitrage**

This repository contains the project files for an AI-driven electricity price forecasting system developed as part of the Shell-Edunet Skills4Future AICTE Internship. 

### **1\. About This Project** 

* The electricity market is becoming increasingly dynamic due to fluctuating demand, renewable generation, and fuel prices. Accurate real-time electricity price forecasting can help consumers, industries, and energy companies make smarter economic decisions.   
* This project develops a machine learning-based system that predicts short-term electricity prices and uses these forecasts to simulate an energy arbitrage strategy.   
* The arbitrage mechanism involves buying and storing electricity when prices are low and selling or using it when prices are high.   
* By applying predictive modeling and optimization techniques, this project aims to maximize profit, reduce energy costs, and demonstrate the role of AI in smart energy trading and management. 

### **2\. The Problem** 

* Electricity prices in competitive markets change rapidly based on demand, generation, and external conditions such as weather or fuel cost.   
* Without predictive insights, energy consumers and storage operators cannot optimize when to buy, store, or sell electricity. 

### **3\. Project Objectives** 

* The challenge is to design an AI-driven forecasting and decision-making system that can :   
  * **Forecast :** Collect and preprocess electricity market data and develop ML models to predict short-term electricity prices with high accuracy.   
  * **Simulate :** Design an energy arbitrage simulation using battery storage that uses price predictions to plan buy/sell operations.   
  * **Evaluate :** Evaluate how well predictive models can increase savings or profits by assessing forecast accuracy and the financial performance of the arbitrage strategy.   
  * **Visualize :** Develop interactive dashboards to visualize forecasting results, price trends, and arbitrage profits. 

### **4\. Tools & Technologies** 

* This project will be developed using the following tools :   
  * **Programming Language :** Python   
  * **Data Handling :** Pandas, NumPy   
  * **Machine Learning :** Scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM   
  * **Deep Learning :** TensorFlow / Keras, PyTorch   
  * **Time-Series Modeling :** Statsmodels, Prophet   
  * **Visualization :** Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly   
  * **Dashboard :** Streamlit / Dash
